<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>THE hero
of the subjoined poem, has for many years been suspected of being
guilty of the most abominable and atrocious practices; his
intimacy with the Vere Street nest of miscreants is too well
known to be again repeated, as are also his detestable letters,
sent to men, to entice them to participate in his guilt.&nbsp; At
the Middlesex Sessions, July 12, 1813, he was tried for an
attempt on William Webster, but acquitted; from which time, he
has been considered <i>innocent</i> by his misled
followers.&nbsp; But on the 26th of September, 1816, he made an
assault on Adam Foreman, (apprentice to Mr. Patrick, potter,
Vauxhall,) with an intent to commit a vile act; for which
attempt, by the laudable exertions of the lad&rsquo;s father, and
Mr. Patrick, he was indicted at the Surrey Assizes, Croydon, on
Saturday, Aug. 16th, 1817, and found guilty; he will be brought
up the first day of next Term to receive judgement, in The Court
of King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney undertook his cause with
reluctance.</p>
<p>While the prosecution of Church was pending, one of the parish
officers of St. George&rsquo;s, Southwark, was applied to by Mrs.
Church for the relief of a man who was in distress at Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The officer waited on the man, and on
interrogating him, in the presence of Mrs. Church, and a daughter
of Church&rsquo;s, by his first wife, (an interesting female,
about seventeen years of age;) he confessed he had been confined
in Newgate one year and a day, for an assault of an abominable
nature, and was partly supported there by Mr. Church; upon
hearing which, Mrs. Church was so much affected, that she was
with difficulty prevented from throwing herself out of the window
of the room.&nbsp; As soon, however as she had somewhat recovered
from this farther proof of the brutal propensity of her husband,
she expressed a wish that the circumstance should not be made
known; to which the officer acquiesced, on condition, that if a
verdict of guilty was found, he should then be at liberty to give
it full publicity.</p>
<p>The following confessional letter, from <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, was sent to the Rev. Mr. L&mdash;,
two days after the offence had been committed.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I can
scarcely write this note, my soul is too deeply pierced.&nbsp;
About eight or nine years ago Dr. Draper left the church in the
Borough, and God opened Chapel-court for me, many attended and
have been blest; now a singular providence, but a most
distressing one, has occurred to take me shortly from my dear,
dear family <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>and beloved congregation.&nbsp; But God has sent Mr.
L&mdash;to preach the truth to my poor dispersed flock, at least
so it appears to me, and I would do all the good to promote the
success of Mr. L&mdash; that my poor people might <i>not</i> be
starved till I return to them in peace, which may be many
months.&nbsp; My heart is broken, my enemies have ruined me at
last, and I shall never surmount it; an unpleasant affair
happening at Vauxhall, is <i>added</i> too, and I must take the
consequences: no arm can help, relieve, or deliver, but the
Lord&rsquo;s, and I feel persuaded the Lord will <i>not</i>:
judge my feelings if you can.&nbsp; I shall secretly come and
hear you, to get all the good I can to a heart deprest,
disconsolate, and full of woe.&nbsp; Oh, the joy of my
enemies!&nbsp; Oh, the distress of my friends!&nbsp; Oh, my poor
heart!&nbsp; Let a sigh go up to God for me when you can.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your&rsquo;s, in the utmost
distress,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following character has been given of <span
class="smcap">Church</span> by Mr. and Mrs. Gee, of the New Cut,
who keep a cake-shop, where he once lodged:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. <span class="smcap">Church</span>, the
minister, lodged at our house a year and a half, and left last
year at Lady-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in hopes that we were about to have a godly
praying minister in our house; and to be sure the first night he
had somewhat like a prayer, and that once afterwards were the
only times he ever went to family prayer in our house.&nbsp; Nor
could they have any prayer, as he would be frequently out almost
all hours of the night, and would lie in bed till ten in the
morning.&nbsp; Several times he and his wife would have
skirmishings and fightings between themselves, while the children
would be left to run about the streets out of school hours, and
allowed to keep company with children that would swear in our
hearing most shockingly.&nbsp; His children were always left to
be very dirty, and would be sent sometimes three or four times in
the morning for spirituous liquors of all sorts.&nbsp; As for
reading good books, or even the bible, he scarce ever thought of
it, but would spend a deal of his time in loose and vain talk, in
walking about, and fawning upon young men, that was his chief
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sundays and working days were all alike to them, for
they would send out to buy liquors, and whatever else they
wanted, on Sundays as well as other days.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;The house would be more frequently like a
play-house (I might say a brothel) than a minister&rsquo;s house,
where a set of young people would come and behave more indecently
than ought to be mentioned.&nbsp; Even one Sunday morning they
made such an uproar as that they broke one of the windows, then
they would go with him to his chapel, and, after that, he would
give the sacrament to such disorderly people, let there
characters be ever so loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always ready to go fast enough out to dinner or
supper where he could get good eating and drinking, but poor
people might send to him from their sick bed times and times
before he would come to them.&nbsp; Seeing so many
inconsistences, and shocking filthiness in their rooms, (though
they always paid their rent) we were determined to give them
warning to quit our house, and we do not think that a worse man
or woman ever came into any house before, especially as Mr.
Church pretended to preach the gospel; such hypocrites are much
worse than others, and, besides this, we never heard a man tell
lies so fast in all our lives.&nbsp; It is a great grief to us
that we ever went to hear him preach, or suffered him to stop so
long in our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George and
Frances Gee</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears from the testimony of George Tarrier, and James
Russell, of Redcross-st.; and William Williams, of the Mint; that
the <i>Rev. John Church</i>, on the 16th of November, 1809,
attended at the funeral of Richard Oakden, a clerk in the Bank,
who was hung before Newgate, for an abominable offence, on 14th
November, 1809.&nbsp; This <i>pious</i> minister and his
partizans returned to the Hat and Feathers, Gravel-lane, kept by
a Mr. Richardson, where the funeral set out from, to partake of a
jovial dinner.&nbsp; His conduct here, it seems, was beyond
description.</p>
<p>It is averred, that his wife, upon hearing the infamy of his
conduct took to drinking, to avoid reflection, which soon
occasioned her death.&nbsp; But, within the last three months,
since he has been charged with the above detestable offence, in
order (we presume under the mask of hypocrisy,) to rescue, in
some degree, his character from the public odium with which it
had been marked, he has been induced to marry a respectable
woman, who kept a seminary for young ladies at Hammersmith.&nbsp;
The verdict <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>of &lsquo;Guilty&rsquo; had been scarcely pronounced,
when the relatives of the children, with the greatest promptitude
possible, took them all away from the said school.</p>
<p>Since his conviction, Church has resided at the house of <span
class="GutSmall">A FRIEND</span>, where <span
class="GutSmall">HIS FOLLOWERS</span> are admitted to see him on
producing a card signed by himself, on which are inscribed
certain texts of scripture.&nbsp; Will this wretch never cease
blaspheming the holy scriptures by his appropriation of them?</p>
<p>From his own account, the profits arising from the Surrey
Tabernacle was from 1000<i>l.</i> to 1200<i>l.</i> annually.</p>
<p>The reader will perceive by the following whimsical poem, that
his <i>old friend</i> and <i>colleague</i>, when he had safely
ensnared him, left him to extricate himself in the best manner he
could.</p>
<h2><span class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
DEVIL &amp; PARSON CHURCH;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
Birds of a Feather.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Old Lucifer</span> came on
earth one day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was in merry plight,<br />
To look for a meal of dainty prey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pamper his appetite!</p>
<p class="poetry">He stalk&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the courts of law,
but grinn&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To find stale picking was there;<br />
For his maw both <span class="GutSmall">BENCH</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">BAR</span> had thinn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all look&rsquo;d devilish bare.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>He walk&rsquo;d up the Park, and down the <span
class="GutSmall">MELL</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To catch some rare rich sinner,<br />
Whom he might drag on his horns to hell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pick his bones for dinner.</p>
<p class="poetry">But nought was there but a bawd or two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scatter&rsquo;d along the benches.<br />
Whose visages look&rsquo;d most <span
class="GutSmall">BLEACH&rsquo;D</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">BLUE</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For none would buy their wenches.</p>
<p class="poetry">He went to the mansions round about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And just by way of frolic,<br />
He pinch&rsquo;d this courtier&rsquo;s toe with the gout,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave to that the cholic.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet thro&rsquo; the circle he found not one,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still his chops kept licking;<br />
No morsel of meat&mdash;no tempting bone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That could deserve his picking.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then over Westminster bridge he trudged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clad in his murky jacket,<br />
And swore that before he homeward budg&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d still kick up a racket</p>
<p class="poetry">He came to a place by wits
y&rsquo;clep&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fields</span>, though no grass
was growing,<br />
Where flocks of Cyprians alone are kept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeds of disaster sowing.</p>
<p class="poetry">And into a chapel here he popp&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That head of his so prying,<br />
And anxious to hear what pass&rsquo;d there, stopp&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attracted by the sighing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>And there he beheld, with strait comb&rsquo;d locks,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eyes with ardour filling,<br />
A <span class="GutSmall">KNAVE</span>, who rock&rsquo;d like one
in the stocks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spoke in strains most killing.</p>
<p class="poetry">As soon as the <span
class="GutSmall">DE&rsquo;EL</span> the wight discern&rsquo;d,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And saw what he was after,<br />
Altho&rsquo; to mince the <span class="GutSmall">VILLAIN</span>
he burn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had well nigh burst with laughter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Up to the pulpit he straightway went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With face as bold as Turpin;<br />
Quoth he to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Sure heav&rsquo;n ne&rsquo;er
meant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such place for <i>thee</i> to chirp in!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He ask&rsquo;d of the Clerk the Parson&rsquo;s
name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Church</span>!&rdquo;
quoth the amen-grinder;<br />
&ldquo;A saint he is of unequall&rsquo;d fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A staunch game gospel-finder!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll plumb his depth:&rdquo; the
devil then quoth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And up the steps he mounted,<br />
And as he march&rsquo;d up, the Clerk most loth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shook, as his steps he counted.</p>
<p class="poetry">He mounted the steps, the Parson&rsquo;s eye<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon glanc&rsquo;d the Demon coming,<br />
But he felt not frighten&rsquo;d, coy nor shy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still kept on his strumming.</p>
<p class="poetry">The <span class="GutSmall">FIEND</span>
suggested, the sermon done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They should to a rendezvous,<br />
Where they might each have a taste of fun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With an Adonis or two.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Now <span class="smcap">Church</span> who us&rsquo;d from
his infancy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In such things to be dabbling,<br />
Squeez&rsquo;d the fiend&rsquo;s fist, and wink&rsquo;d his
eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then cut short his gabbling.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away they went, as the <span
class="GutSmall">DEV&rsquo;L</span> had said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both arm in arm together,<br />
And up to the place of meeting sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like horses to their tether.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then the frolic and fun began,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heav&rsquo;n look&rsquo;d on with sorrow,<br />
And sigh&rsquo;d that man should make beast of man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As &rsquo;erst in vile Gomorrah!</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the <span
class="GutSmall">DEV&rsquo;L</span> had set his net so well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To catch the <span class="GutSmall">PIOUS
GUDGEON</span>,<br />
That into the <span class="GutSmall">MESH</span> he promptly
fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flound&rsquo;ring in doleful <span
class="GutSmall">DUDGEON</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then the <span
class="GutSmall">DEVIL</span> relax&rsquo;d his claw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And left him melancholy,<br />
Within the clutches of Mister Law,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To trounce him for his folly.</p>
<p class="poetry">Off flew the <span
class="GutSmall">DEV&rsquo;L</span> to hell to prepare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His <span class="GutSmall">FRYING-PAN</span> and
<span class="GutSmall">DRIPPING</span>,<br />
To fry the <span class="GutSmall">FLAT</span> when he got him
there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom he had just caught tripping.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now good people with one accord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who us&rsquo;d to hear him praying,<br />
Go get a new priest, and ask the Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep the knave from straying.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
